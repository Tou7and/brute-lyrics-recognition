You know who it is
Coming 'round again
You want a dose of this, right now it's K/DA uh!
I'm a goddess with a blade
소리쳐봐 내 이름 잊지 못하게
Loud loud loud loud
I could take it to the top
절대 멈추지 못해
내가 끝내주는
Bad gal gal gal
And when I start to talk like that (like that)
Oh you won't know how to react
I'm a picture perfect face
With that wild in my veins
You can hear it in my growl, growl, growl, growl
So keep your eyes on me now
무엇을 보든 좋아할 거야
닿을 수 없는 level
나와 대결 원한 널 확신해
We gotta it all in our hands now
So can you handle what we're all about
We're so tough
Not scared to show you up
Can you feel the rush now?
Ain't nobody bringing us
Down down down down down down
They could try but we're gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round round round round round round
Wish you luck but you're not bringing us down
All we go hard till we get it, get it
We go hard
We so in it, in it
We pop stars (pop stars)
Only winning winning now
Ain't nobody bringing us
Down down down down (hey!)
You ready for this? Let's go!
See 언제든지 내 모습 magic
단 한 번에 내가 잡어 절대 기죽지 않지 uh!
Pow pow 네가 뭘 알아 (알아)
견딜 수 없어, 원해도 (해도)
원하는 게 얼굴에 보여
I'm trouble and you're wanting it
I'm so cold (so cold)
When I move that way
You gonna be so blown (so blown)
I'm the realest in the game uh!
Say I'm on fire with a blade
You're about to hear my name
Ringing in your head like oh oh oh oh
So keep your eyes on me now
무엇을 보든 좋아할 거야
We're so tough (tough)
Not scared to show you up (up)
Can you feel the rush now?
Ain't nobody bringing us
Down down down down down down
They could try but we're gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round round round round round round
Wish you luck but you're not bringing us down
We go hard till we get it, get it
We go hard
We so in it, in it
We pop stars (stars)
Only winning winning now
Ain't nobody bringing us
Down down down down
Ooh, mm, oh 난 멈추지 않아
Oh oh we go hard
Oh oh we pop stars, stars
Ain't nobody bringing us
Ain't nobody bringing us
Down down down down down down
They could try but we're gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round round round round round round
Wish you luck but you're not bringing us down
We go hard till we get it, get it
We go hard

We pop stars (stars)
Only winning winning now
Ain't nobody bringing us
Down down down down
