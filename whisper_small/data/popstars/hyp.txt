내가 끝내주는 매갱땡 You and I start a tarte d'albae Oh you know how to react I'm a picture perfect face with the world in my veins You can hear it in my girl girl girl So keep your eyes on me now I'll love you no matter what
다일 수 없는 바보 나와대게 원한 날 확신해 We got it all in our hands now So can you handle what we're all about What's your toast? Let's get it show you up Can you feel the rush now? Ain't nobody bringing us down Down down down down down down down Like a tribal...
Wanna wear the crown, you can go another round Round, round, round, round, round, round Wish you luck, but you're not bringing us down Go hard, till we get it, get it, we go hard We're so in it, in it, we pop stars Only winning, winning, no Ain't nobody brilliant Go, no, hey, no
You ready for this? Let's go! See 언제든지 내 모습 매직 단 한 번에 내가 잡아 절대 기죽지 않지 어 펴 편의가 뭐라러 근데 수어서 원해도 원하는 게 얼굴에 보여 I'm troubling you One in me I'm so cold When I move that way you gon' be so blown I'm the realest in the game uh薄 Subscribe預

You can go another round, round, round, round, round, round, round, round Wish you luck with what you're now bringing us down We go hard, so we get it, get it, we go hard We're so in it, in it, we pop stars Only winning, winning, and nobody breath Go, go, go, go, go.
