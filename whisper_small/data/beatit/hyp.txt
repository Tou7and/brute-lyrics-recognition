You
Don't you ever do
I'm a rocker, don't wanna see your face, you better disappear The fire's in the eyes, and their words are really clear So beat it, just beat it You better run, you better do what you can Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a mantra man You wanna beat the...
Better do what you can so beat it But you wanna be better, beat it, beat it You better know what to beat, beat it So I'm fucking strong, just jump right up It doesn't matter who's stronger, right? Just beat it
Just be the, just be the, just be the There's a get you better leave while you can Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man You wanna stay alive better do what you can Can't so be the, just be the, ooh
You have the soul, though not your daily mind's clear You're playing with your life, it's a no true love, yeah They'll get you, then they'll beat you They'll tell you it's a fair song, beat it, beat it But you wanna be the better Beat it, beat it, beat it They'll tell you it's a fair song, beat it, beat it
So I'm fucking strong as a factor, it doesn't matter who's wearing the right dress Be it, be it, be it, be it, no one was defeated So I'm fucking strong as a factor, it doesn't matter who's wearing the right dress
