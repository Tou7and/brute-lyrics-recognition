#  Once upon a time, a blue sky filled with many shining colors I searched for it in pain I promise I'll see you I closed my eyes, trying to make a promise I remember this hand, more than words, or memories The way you talk to me, so hot and wet Someday my mind, shivering withigo, will reach you We aim to complete today I can't find the truth Trans Explain The tension states the sky Bury you too close to hope A欲 thể knows passingisi It is the blood for ever A heart of leather It has a tale of seeking Only how she has been It doesn't seem like Anyway, as you see There will be no There will be no There will be no There will be no destiny We were experience アッシュ 奥ネタ 僕に語る方法 いつか 空に叫散らまる想い 身 船に流れて 最前の星屑になる 灯火を消せないままで 星屑の中で 星屑の中で 灯火を消せないままで 灯火
